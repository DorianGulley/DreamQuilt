# DreamQuilt

**Creator:** Dorian Gulley

## Description

DreamQuilt is a collaborative platform for creators to weave together fictional universes. Users can post their own creative ideas as "quilts" and invite others to contributeâ€”whether that's plot development, concept art, or world-building. The platform is designed for writers, artists, and fans to expand and enrich stories together, making it ideal for everything from novels and manga to documentaries.

- **Quilt Creation:** Start a new quilt (story) and set its category, content, and tags.
- **Quilt Feed:** Browse, search, and filter all quilts on the home page.
- **Contributions:** Add ideas, art, or plot twists to any quilt.
- **Profile Pages:** View your own and others' profiles, including bios, created quilts, and contributions.
