# DreamQuilt

**Creator:** Dorian Gulley

## Description

DreamQuilt is a collaborative platform for creators to weave together fictional universes. Users can post their own creative ideas as "quilts" and invite others to contribute "patches" (story segments) that expand the narrative. The platform features an interactive node-based visualization system that displays story relationships in a tree structure, making it ideal for writers, artists, and fans to expand and enrich stories together.

- **Patch System:** Add story segments with rich text content, tags, and parent-child relationships
- **Ownership & Moderation:** Quilt owners can directly publish patches while others submit suggestions for review

### **Advanced Features**

- **Dynamic Tree Layout:** Recursive positioning algorithm for intuitive story progression visualization
